# WordPress
[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) is one of the most versatile open source content management systems on the market. A publishing platform for building blogs and websites.

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [WordPress](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-wordpress) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

It also packages the [Bitnami MariaDB chart](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/stable/mariadb) which is required for bootstrapping a MariaDB deployment for the database requirements of the WordPress application.

Bitnami charts can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.com/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters. This chart has been tested to work with NGINX Ingress, cert-manager, fluentd and Prometheus on top of the [BKPR](https://kubeprod.io/).

## Upgrade Notes: 
Upgrading from version < 7.3.8 is NOT supported, please backup your WordPress database and creating a new app for it.
